# odin-recipes
This project is my first one, as well as the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. Through it, I consolidated the knowledge I gained during the course.

I used basic HTML features, such as the fundamental structure of an HTML document, headings, paragraphs, and lists. Additionally, I incorporated links, images, and tried to organize everything as effectively as possible.
